 * first, which makes a sign-out take effect at once. An entry only has to
 * outlive the last access token of its session.
 *
 * Without Redis the check cannot be made and a signed-out device works until
 * its token expires, as it did before this existed. Its refresh token is
 * revoked in the database either way, so it can never renew.
